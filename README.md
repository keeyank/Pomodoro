I'm trying to find the balance between using ChatGPT to help me learn how to use Dart / Flutter and using the Docs. So far, both have been very helpful - the Docs for going in depth on a topic for my own learning (e.g., managing state using things like ChangeNotifiers, Themes and Material Design), and ChatGPT has been helpful as a coding assistant. I recently copy/pasted my main.dart into ChatGPT and pointed out a line that was causing an error (involving using the player to play a sound), and it neatly broke down the problem and told me what to do to fix it. I reviewed the code it gave me, made sure I understood where I went wrong, and applied the changes. So far, so good!

Now that the functionality is becoming a bit more complex for this simple utility app, I'm starting to wonder if I should spend more time attempting to figure out 'best practise' ways to approach it. My knowledge of front-end development is lacking, and I'm really tackling this head-on and addressing challenges as they come up. There was a fireship course I'm considering taking a look at to potentially fill in the blanks - it would be good to learn about new tools within Flutter / Dart, and learn more about the underlying framework that makes everything possible. We'll see.

AI has really been helping me build this app so quickly. I'm using Claude, and I'm able to upload my main.dart file, prompt it to add a new UI component (I did this with the banner), and it spits out some good code that I can actually use. Sometimes the code or layout isn't quite what I wanted, so I'll explain this to Claude and it'll correct itself. Throughout all of this, I'm taking extra care to understand everything I use it for - I don't want to let myself get to the point where I'm mindlessly copy pasting the code it provides me with without vetting it and understanding it first. It's a tool to help speed up my workflow, but it still requires an understanding of what the code does along with some minor tweaking of the cod whenever necessary.

I used AI to generate the little tomato logo as well, really nifty!
