I'm trying to find the balance between using ChatGPT to help me learn how to use Dart / Flutter and using the Docs. So far, both have been very helpful - the Docs for going in depth on a topic for my own learning (e.g., managing state using things like ChangeNotifiers, Themes and Material Design), and ChatGPT has been helpful as a coding assistant. I recently copy/pasted my main.dart into ChatGPT and pointed out a line that was causing an error (involving using the player to play a sound), and it neatly broke down the problem and told me what to do to fix it. I reviewed the code it gave me, made sure I understood where I went wrong, and applied the changes. So far, so good!

Now that the functionality is becoming a bit more complex for this simple utility app, I'm starting to wonder if I should spend more time attempting to figure out 'best practise' ways to approach it. My knowledge of front-end development is lacking, and I'm really tackling this head-on and addressing challenges as they come up. There was a fireship course I'm considering taking a look at to potentially fill in the blanks - it would be good to learn about new tools within Flutter / Dart, and learn more about the underlying framework that makes everything possible. We'll see.
